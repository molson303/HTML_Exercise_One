<!-- Using raw Javascript, you will be manipulating three text fields, a button, and
a collector div all of which are on an existing HTML page you made. When you click
on the button, javascript reads the contents of the text fields, (input fields), and
populates the div with three h1 tags all containing the text you typed in. You may not
use jQuery . The collector div should reset every time you click the button. (In other
words, it should not just keep accumulating things into an ever increasing list. Every
time you click the button, you see only 3 things appear and they are from your text fields
which may have changes since you last clicked the button. ) -->
